<h1> about me </h1>
  
<p> HI, let me introduce myself to start off: I'm Stephanie Leblanc! From a young age I have always had an intense passion for all things technological, especially computers and the internet. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, mainly due to my love of mathematics; While studying for my degree I was introduced to some basic coding in C++ and have developed an interest & curiosity for the feild ever since.  </p>

<p>When I'm not glued to a screen , I love snowboarding ! I love having long conversations with my friends and family, hours on end; discussing anything from politics to popculture; ideas, theories, concepts, and Dreams!</p>
